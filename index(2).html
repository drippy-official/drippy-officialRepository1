        Hi! We meet again?
        <p>So uh, there's not much to communicate in a website. So uh. <b>Hello, How are you viewer of this website?</b>
            Did you download this from <a href="https://github.com/drippy-official/drippy-officialRepository1">https://github.com/drippy-official/drippy-officialRepository1?</a> Or is this already in your computer, phone, laptop, tablet. I don't know. I can't see what you downloaded by the way.</p>
            <br>
            Download <b>index(3).html</b> if you want to read more from mine.
